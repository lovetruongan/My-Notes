# Advanced Linux Concepts and Commands

## System Administration

### Process Management

- `nice` and `renice`: Adjust process priority
- `ionice`: Set or get process I/O scheduling class and priority
- `chrt`: Manipulate real-time attributes of a process
- `taskset`: Set or retrieve a process's CPU affinity

### System Monitoring

- `sar`: Collect, report, or save system activity information
- `iostat`: Report CPU statistics and I/O statistics for devices and partitions
- `vmstat`: Report virtual memory statistics
- `netstat`: Print network connections, routing tables, interface statistics, masquerade connections, and multicast memberships

### Advanced Networking

- `ss`: Another utility to investigate sockets
- `ip`: Show / manipulate routing, network devices, interfaces and tunnels
- `tc`: Traffic Control in Linux, used to configure the kernel packet scheduler
- `iptables`: Administration tool for IPv4/IPv6 packet filtering and NAT

## File System Management

### Advanced File Systems

- LVM (Logical Volume Management): Flexible disk space management
- ZFS: Advanced file system with features like snapshots, copy-on-write, and RAID-Z
- Btrfs: A copy-on-write file system for Linux

### File System Operations

- `dd`: Convert and copy a file, write disk headers, boot records
- `rsync`: Fast, versatile file copying tool for remote and local files
- `lsof`: List open files
- `fuser`: Identify processes using files or sockets

## Shell Scripting and Automation

### Advanced Bash Features

- Process substitution: `<(command)` and `>(command)`
- Parameter expansion: ${parameter:-word}, ${parameter:=word}, ${parameter:?word}, ${parameter:+word}
- Brace expansion: `echo {1..5}`, `echo {a..z}`

### Text Processing

- `awk`: Pattern scanning and processing language
- `sed`: Stream editor for filtering and transforming text
- `cut`: Remove sections from each line of files
- `tr`: Translate or delete characters

## Security and Encryption

- `openssl`: Cryptography toolkit
- `gpg`: GNU Privacy Guard for encryption and signing
- `fail2ban`: Intrusion prevention software framework
- `auditd`: System call auditing

## Containerization and Virtualization

- Docker: Platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers
- LXC/LXD: Linux Containers
- KVM: Kernel-based Virtual Machine

## Performance Tuning

- `perf`: Linux profiling with performance counters
- `strace`: Trace system calls and signals
- `ltrace`: A library call tracer

## System Boot and Init Systems

- GRUB configuration and customization
- systemd: System and service manager
- Alternatives to systemd (e.g., SysV init, Upstart)

## Kernel Management

- Compiling custom kernels
- Loadable Kernel Modules
- sysctl for runtime kernel parameter tuning

## Advanced Networking

- Bridging and bonding network interfaces
- VLANs (Virtual LANs)
- Network namespaces

## High Availability and Clustering

- Pacemaker and Corosync for cluster resource management
- DRBD (Distributed Replicated Block Device) for block-level replication

## Backup and Recovery

- Amanda: Advanced Maryland Automatic Network Disk Archiver
- Bacula: Open-source network backup solution

Remember that mastering these advanced concepts requires hands-on practice and continuous learning. Always refer to the official documentation and man pages for the most up-to-date and detailed information.
